1. We can use the binary repesentation for the numbers 1 to 1000 like
	for 1 it's 000000000000001
	for 2 it's 000000000000010
	
	and so on
	
	We can then arrange the 15 prisoners as these bits and ask the prisoners who have the bit next to them marked as 1 to drink that bottle's wine. Now, to guess the bottle with poison, all the prisoners who die would be marked as 1 and others as 0. The decimal representation for the binary number so obtained would give us the bottle number.
	
	For example, if only 1st 3rd and 5th prisoner died, then,
		000000000010101
	So, the bottle with poison was bottle number 21.
	
	
2. Chessboard:


	a. Number of squares.
		square with side as 1 : 8(horizontal) * 8(vertical)  , we have multiplied these as these are across the board.
		square with side as 2 : 7(horizontal) * 7(vertical)
		square with side as 3 : 6(horizontal) * 6(vertical)
		square with side as 4 : 5(horizontal) * 5(vertical)
		square with side as 5 : 4(horizontal) * 4(vertical)
		square with side as 6 : 3(horizontal) * 3(vertical)
		square with side as 7 : 2(horizontal) * 2(vertical)
		square with side as 8 : 1
		
		Total square = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 = 204
		
	b. Number of overlapping edges:
			There are total 204 squares, thus total of 204*4 edges = 816 edges.
			The edges of the squares that are on the outermost region of the chessboard won't be overlapped.
			
			For squares of size 1:
				Total squares = 64, total edges = 64*4 = 256
				Edges that are on the outermost region of the chessboard = 8*4 = 32 (won't be overlapped) [because we have 32 square edges in the outermost regions]
				
				
				Overlapping edges = 256-32 = 224, Non overlapping edges = 32
				
			For squares of size 2:
				Total squares = 49, total edges = 49*4 = 196
				Edges that are on the outermost region of the chessboard = 7*4 = 28 (won't be overlapped)
				Also, we would have non overapping squares from the second row and column which would form non overlapping square sides = 7*4 = 28
				
				Overlapping edges = 196 - 56 = 140, Non overlapping edges = 28+28 = 56
				
			For squares of size 3:
				Total squares = 36, total edges = 36*4 = 144
				Edges that are on the outermost region of the chessboard = 6*4 = 24 (won't be overlapped)
				Also, we would have non overapping squares from the second,third rows and columns which would form non overlapping square sides = (6*4)*2 = 48
				
				Overlapping edges = 144-72 = 72, Non overlapping edges = 48+24 = 72
				
			For squares of size 4:
				Total squares = 25, total edges = 25*4 = 100
				Edges that are on the outermost region of the chessboard = 5*4 = 20 (won't be overlapped)
				Also, we would have non overapping squares from the second,third and fourth rows and columns which would form non overlapping square sides = (5*4)*3 = 60
				
				Overlapping edges = 100-80 = 20, Non overlapping edges = 60+20 = 80
			
			For square of size 5 and greater there would be no overlapping:
				Overlapping edges = 0 , Non overlapping edges = (16+9+4+1)*4 = 120
				
	So, total overlapping  = 224+140+72+20 = 456, and non-overlapping = 32+56+72+80+120=360
